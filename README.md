# Udacity-Neighborhood-Map

This project was part of my Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity 🎓. We developed an application featuring a map of your neighborhood and also added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, requesting third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content and how to avoid spaghetti-code. 🍝

## Features
The app..
- marks the provided locations on the map. 📍 (I've provided the name and the coordinates for 5 very popular coffeehouses in Graz ☕)
- requests additional informations about the locations (like the address or even a photo! 📸) through the Foursquare API.
- presents the specific location information in an Infobox if the marker or the item in the list is clicked.
- bounces the marker if it is clicked! 🙌🙌
- also allows you to filter your locations. 😲
- is responsive and looks great on all screens.📲
